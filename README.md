## 1. Code components

Rubber Band consists of:

 * The Rubber Band Library code.  This is the code that will normally
   be used by your applications.  The headers for this are in the
   rubberband/ directory, and the source code is in src/.
   The Rubber Band Library may also depend upon external resampler
   and FFT code; see section 3a below for details.

 * The Rubber Band command-line tool.  This is in main/main.cpp.
   This program uses the Rubber Band Library and also requires libsndfile
   (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/, licensed under the GNU Lesser
   General Public License) for audio file loading.

 * A pitch-shifter LADSPA audio effects plugin.  This is in ladspa/.
   It requires the LADSPA SDK header ladspa.h (not included).

 * A Vamp audio analysis plugin which may be used to inspect the
   dynamic stretch ratios and other decisions taken by the Rubber Band
   Library when in use.  This is in vamp/.  It requires the Vamp
   plugin SDK (https://www.vamp-plugins.org/develop.html) (not included).


## 2. Using the Rubber Band command-line tool

The Rubber Band command-line tool builds as bin/rubberband.  The basic
incantation is

```
  $ rubberband -t <timeratio> -p <pitchratio> <infile.wav> <outfile.wav>
```

For example,

```
  $ rubberband -t 1.5 -p 2.0 test.wav output.wav
```

stretches the file test.wav to 50% longer than its original duration,
shifts it up in pitch by one octave, and writes the output to output.wav.

Several further options are available: run "rubberband -h" for help.
In particular, different types of music may benefit from different
"crispness" options (-c flag with a numerical argument from 0 to 6).


## 3. Using the Rubber Band Library

The Rubber Band Library has a public API that consists of one C++
class, called RubberBandStretcher in the RubberBand namespace.  You
should `#include <rubberband/RubberBandStretcher.h>` to use this
class.  There is extensive documentation in the class header.

A header with C language bindings is also provided in
`<rubberband/rubberband-c.h>`.  This is a wrapper around the C++
implementation, and as the implementation is the same, it also
requires linkage against the C++ standard libraries.  It is not yet
documented separately from the C++ header.  You should include only
one of the two headers, not both.

A .NET interface is also included, contributed by Jonathan Gilbert;
see the files in the `dotnet` directory for details.

The source code for the command-line utility (`main/main.cpp`)
provides a good example of how to use Rubber Band in offline mode; the
LADSPA pitch shifter plugin (`ladspa/RubberBandPitchShifter.cpp`) may
be used as an example of Rubber Band in real-time mode.

IMPORTANT: Please ensure you have read and understood the licensing
terms for Rubber Band before using it in your application.  This
library is provided under the GNU General Public License, which means
that any application that uses it must also be published under the GPL
or a compatible licence (i.e. with its full source code also available
for modification and redistribution) unless you have separately
acquired a commercial licence from the author.


## 4. Compiling the Rubber Band Library

The primary supported build system for the Rubber Band Library on all
platforms is Meson (https://mesonbuild.com). To build, ensure Meson
and Ninja are installed and run:

```
$ meson build && ninja -C build
```

This checks for necessary dependencies, reports what it finds, and if
all is well, builds the code into a subdirectory called `build`. It
will build everything it can find the requisite dependencies for:
static and dynamic libraries, LADSPA and Vamp plugins, and
command-line utility.

Some configuration options are provided, described in the
`meson_options.txt` file. To set one of these, add a `-D` option to
Meson:

```
$ meson build -Dipp_path=/opt/intel/ipp
```

The options are documented in the library- and platform-specific
sections below.

For those who don't wish to use Meson, some alternative build files
(Makefiles and Visual C++ projects) are included in the `otherbuilds`
directory. These build only the static library.

The Rubber Band Library is written entirely in C++ to the C++98
standard. It is unlikely to make any difference (performance or
otherwise) which C++ standard your compiler uses - as long as it's no
older than C++98!

If you are building this software using either of the Speex or KissFFT
library options, please be sure to review the terms for those
libraries in `src/speex/COPYING` and `src/kissfft/COPYING` as
applicable.


### 4a. Building on Linux

For best results, and to ensure the command-line tool and plugins are
built, first install libsamplerate, libsndfile, and the LADSPA and
Vamp plugin headers so they can be found using `pkg-config`. Then

```
$ meson build && ninja -C build
```

See "FFT and resampler selection" below for further build options.

Alternatively, if you only need the static library and prefer a
Makefile, try

```
$ make -f otherbuilds/Makefile.linux
```


### 4b. Building on macOS

Ensure the Xcode command-line tools are installed, and ideally also
install libsamplerate and libsndfile.

To build for the default architecture:

```
$ meson build && ninja -C build
```

Which architecture is the default may depend on the version of Meson
and/or the current shell. To force a particular architecture you can
use a Meson cross-file, as follows.

To build for Apple Silicon (arm64):

```
$ meson build --cross-file cross/macos-arm64.txt && ninja -C build
```

To build for Intel (x86_64):

```
$ meson build --cross-file cross/macos-x86_64.txt && ninja -C build
```

You can build a universal binary library for both architectures like
this:

```
$ meson build --cross-file cross/macos-universal.txt && ninja -C build
```

However, the resulting binary will be marked as loadable on macOS 11+
only, even for Intel, which is probably not what you want (ideally the
Intel slice would support older versions of the OS). A Makefile that
handles this explicitly is also provided:

```
$ make -f otherbuilds/Makefile.macos-universal
```

This produces only a static library, but it's a universal binary that
is compatible with macOS 10.7 onwards on the Intel side.

See "FFT and resampler selection" below for further build options.

Note that you cannot legally distribute applications using Rubber Band
in the Mac App Store, unless you have first obtained a commercial
licence for the Rubber Band Library.  GPL code is not permitted in the
app store.  See https://breakfastquay.com/technology/license.html for
commercial terms.


### 4c. Building for iOS

Ensure the Xcode command-line tools are installed, and

```
$ meson build_ios --cross-file cross/ios.txt && ninja -C build
```

The output files will be found in the `build_ios` directory.

To build for the simulator,

```
$ meson build_sim --cross-file cross/ios-simulator.txt && ninja -C build
```

The output files will be found in the `build_sim` directory.

See "FFT and resampler selection" below for further build options.

Note that you cannot legally distribute applications using Rubber Band
in the iOS App Store, unless you have a first obtained a commercial
licence for the Rubber Band Library. GPL code is not permitted in the
app store.  See https://breakfastquay.com/technology/license.html for
commercial terms.


### 4d. Building on Windows

The default build on Windows also uses Meson, so ensure Meson and
Ninja are installed and available. Then, in a terminal window with the
compiler tools available in the path (e.g. a Visual Studio
command-line prompt for the relevant build architecture) run

```
> meson build
> ninja -C build
```

The output files will be found in the `build` directory.

The Rubber Band code is compatible with both the traditional Visual
C++ compiler (`cl`) and the Clang front-end (`clang`), and the build
system will use whichever appears (first) in your path.

To build against a specific Visual C++ runtime, use the built-in Meson
option `b_vscrt`:

```
> meson build -Db_vscrt=mt
```

See "FFT and resampler selection" below for further build options.

Alternatively, if you only need the static library and prefer a Visual
Studio project file, there is one targeted for VC 2015 in
`otherbuilds\rubberband-library.vcxproj`.


### 4e. Building for Android and Java integration

Currently only a very old Android NDK build file is provided, as
`otherbuilds/Android.mk`. This includes compile definitions for a
shared library built for ARM architectures which can be loaded from a
Java application using the Java native interface (i.e. the Android
NDK).

The Java side of the interface can be found in
`com/breakfastquay/rubberband/RubberBandStretcher.java`.

See
https://hg.sr.ht/~breakfastquay/rubberband-android-simple-sample
for a very trivial example of integration with Android Java code.

The supplied `.mk` file uses KissFFT and the Speex resampler.


### 4f. FFT and resampler selection

Rubber Band requires the selection of library code for FFT calculation
and resampling.  Several libraries are supported.  The selection is
controlled (in Meson) using `-D` options and (in the code itself)
using preprocessor flags set by the build system. These options and
flags are detailed in the tables below.

At least one resampler implementation and one FFT implementation must
be enabled. It is technically possible to enable more than one, but
it's confusing and not often useful.

If you are building this software using the bundled Speex or KissFFT
library code, please be sure to review the terms for those libraries
in `src/speex/COPYING` and `src/kissfft/COPYING` as applicable.

If you are proposing to package Rubber Band for a Linux distribution,
please select either the built-in FFT (simpler for you) or FFTW (a bit
faster) and use libsamplerate.
