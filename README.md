## 1. Code components

Rubber Band consists of:

 * The Rubber Band Library code.  This is the code that will normally
   be used by your applications.  The headers for this are in the
   `rubberband/` directory, and the source code is in `src/`.
   The Rubber Band Library may also depend upon external resampler
   and FFT code, if so configured; see section 7 of COMPILING.md for
   details.

 * The Rubber Band command-line tool.  This is in `main/main.cpp`.
   This program uses Rubber Band Library and also requires libsndfile
   (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/, licensed under the GNU Lesser
   General Public License) for audio file loading.

 * A pitch-shifter audio effects plugin in LADSPA and LV2 formats.
   These are in `ladspa-lv2/`. They require the LADSPA SDK header
   `ladspa.h` and LV2 header `lv2.h` respectively (not included).

 * A Vamp audio analysis plugin which may be used to inspect the
   dynamic stretch ratios and other decisions taken by the Rubber Band
   Library when in use.  This is in `vamp/`.  It requires the Vamp
   plugin SDK (https://www.vamp-plugins.org/develop.html) (not included).


## 2. Using the Rubber Band command-line tool

The Rubber Band command-line tool builds as `build/rubberband`.  The
basic incantation is

```
  $ rubberband -t <timeratio> -p <semitones> <infile.wav> <outfile.wav>
```

For example,

```
  $ rubberband -t 1.5 -p 2.0 test.wav output.wav
```

stretches the file `test.wav` to 50% longer than its original
duration, shifts it up in pitch by a whole tone, and writes the output
to `output.wav`.

Several further options are available: run `rubberband -h` for help.

The most important are the options `-2` and `-3`. These select between
two different processing engines, known as the R2 (Faster) engine and
the R3 (Finer) engine. The R3 engine produces higher-quality results
than R2 for most material, especially complex mixes, vocals and other
sounds that have soft onsets and smooth pitch changes, and music with
substantial bass content. However, it uses much more CPU than the R2
engine.

The R2 engine was the only method available in Rubber Band Library up
to versions 2.x, and for compatibility it remains the default (in the
case that neither `-2` nor `-3` is requested explicitly) whenever the
command-line tool is invoked as `rubberband`. The R3 engine is the
default if the tool is invoked as `rubberband-r3`.

Many further options are available, most of which only have an effect
when using the R2 engine.  In particular, different types of music may
benefit from different "crispness" options (`-c` flag, with a
numerical argument from 0 to 6).


## 3. Using Rubber Band Library

Rubber Band has a public API that consists of one C++ class, called
`RubberBandStretcher` in the `RubberBand` namespace.  You should
`#include <rubberband/RubberBandStretcher.h>` to use this class.
There is extensive documentation in the class header.

A header with C language bindings is also provided in
`<rubberband/rubberband-c.h>`.  This is a wrapper around the C++
implementation, and as the implementation is the same, it also
requires linkage against the C++ standard libraries.  It is not yet
documented separately from the C++ header.  You should include only
one of the two headers, not both.

A .NET interface is also included, contributed by Jonathan Gilbert;
see the files in the `dotnet` directory for details.

The source code for the command-line utility (`main/main.cpp`)
provides a good example of how to use Rubber Band in offline mode; the
pitch shifter plugin (`ladspa-lv2/RubberBandPitchShifter.cpp`) may be
used as an example of Rubber Band in real-time mode.

**IMPORTANT:** Please ensure you have read and understood the
licensing terms for Rubber Band before using it in your application.
This library is provided under the GNU General Public License, which
means that any application that uses it must also be published under
the GPL or a compatible licence (i.e. with its full source code also
available for modification and redistribution) unless you have
separately acquired a commercial licence from the author.
