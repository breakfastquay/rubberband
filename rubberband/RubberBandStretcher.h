/**
 * @mainpage RubberBand
 * 
 * The Rubber Band API is contained in the single class
 * RubberBand::RubberBandStretcher.
 *
 * The Rubber Band stretcher supports two processing modes, offline
 * and real-time. The choice of mode is fixed on construction. In
 * offline mode, you must provide the audio block-by-block in two
 * passes: in the first pass calling study(), in the second pass
 * calling process() and receiving the output via retrieve(). In
 * real-time mode, there is no study pass, just a single streaming
 * pass in which the audio is passed to process() and output received
 * via retrieve().
 *
 * In real-time mode you can change the time and pitch ratios at any
 * time, but in offline mode they are fixed and cannot be changed
 * after the study pass has begun. (However, see setKeyFrameMap() for
 * a way to do pre-planned variable time stretching in offline mode.)
 * Offline mode typically produces slightly more precise results.
 *
 * Threading notes for real-time applications:
 * 
 * Multiple instances of RubberBandStretcher may be created and used
 * in separate threads concurrently.  However, for any single instance
 * of RubberBandStretcher, you may not call process() more than once
 * concurrently, and you may not change the time or pitch ratio while
 * a process() call is being executed (if the stretcher was created in
 * "real-time mode"; in "offline mode" you can't change the ratios
 * during use anyway).
 * 
 * So you can run process() in its own thread if you like, but if you
 * want to change ratios dynamically from a different thread, you will
 * need some form of mutex in your code.  Changing the time or pitch
 * ratio is real-time safe except in extreme circumstances, so for
 * most applications that may change these dynamically it probably
 * makes most sense to do so from the same thread as calls process(),
 * even if that is a real-time thread.

    /**
     * Processing options for the timestretcher.  The preferred
     * options should normally be set in the constructor, as a bitwise
     * OR of the option flags.  The default value (DefaultOptions) is
     * intended to give good results in most situations.
     *
     * 1. Flags prefixed \c OptionProcess determine how the timestretcher
     * will be invoked.  These options may not be changed after
     * construction.
     * 
     *   \li \c OptionProcessOffline - Run the stretcher in offline
     *   mode.  In this mode the input data needs to be provided
     *   twice, once to study(), which calculates a stretch profile
     *   for the audio, and once to process(), which stretches it.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionProcessRealTime - Run the stretcher in real-time
     *   mode.  In this mode only process() should be called, and the
     *   stretcher adjusts dynamically in response to the input audio.
     * 
     * The Process setting is likely to depend on your architecture:
     * non-real-time operation on seekable files: Offline; real-time
     * or streaming operation: RealTime.
     *
     * 2. Flags prefixed \c OptionStretch control the profile used for
     * variable timestretching.  Rubber Band always adjusts the
     * stretch profile to minimise stretching of busy broadband
     * transient sounds, but the degree to which it does so is
     * adjustable.  These options may not be changed after
     * construction.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionStretchElastic - Only meaningful in offline
     *   mode, and the default in that mode.  The audio will be
     *   stretched at a variable rate, aimed at preserving the quality
     *   of transient sounds as much as possible.  The timings of low
     *   activity regions between transients may be less exact than
     *   when the precise flag is set.
     * 
     *   \li \c OptionStretchPrecise - Although still using a variable
     *   stretch rate, the audio will be stretched so as to maintain
     *   as close as possible to a linear stretch ratio throughout.
     *   Timing may be better than when using \c OptionStretchElastic, at
     *   slight cost to the sound quality of transients.  This setting
     *   is always used when running in real-time mode.
     *
     * 3. Flags prefixed \c OptionTransients control the component
     * frequency phase-reset mechanism that may be used at transient
     * points to provide clarity and realism to percussion and other
     * significant transient sounds.  These options may be changed
     * after construction when running in real-time mode, but not when
     * running in offline mode.
     * 
     *   \li \c OptionTransientsCrisp - Reset component phases at the
     *   peak of each transient (the start of a significant note or
     *   percussive event).  This, the default setting, usually
     *   results in a clear-sounding output; but it is not always
     *   consistent, and may cause interruptions in stable sounds
     *   present at the same time as transient events.  The
     *   OptionDetector flags (below) can be used to tune this to some
     *   extent.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionTransientsMixed - Reset component phases at the
     *   peak of each transient, outside a frequency range typical of
     *   musical fundamental frequencies.  The results may be more
     *   regular for mixed stable and percussive notes than
     *   \c OptionTransientsCrisp, but with a "phasier" sound.  The
     *   balance may sound very good for certain types of music and
     *   fairly bad for others.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionTransientsSmooth - Do not reset component phases
     *   at any point.  The results will be smoother and more regular
     *   but may be less clear than with either of the other
     *   transients flags.
     *
     * 4. Flags prefixed \c OptionDetector control the type of
     * transient detector used.  These options may be changed
     * after construction when running in real-time mode, but not when
     * running in offline mode.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionDetectorCompound - Use a general-purpose
     *   transient detector which is likely to be good for most
     *   situations.  This is the default.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionDetectorPercussive - Detect percussive
     *   transients.  Note that this was the default and only option
     *   in Rubber Band versions prior to 1.5.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionDetectorSoft - Use an onset detector with less
     *   of a bias toward percussive transients.  This may give better
     *   results with certain material (e.g. relatively monophonic
     *   piano music).
     *
     * 5. Flags prefixed \c OptionPhase control the adjustment of
     * component frequency phases from one analysis window to the next
     * during non-transient segments.  These options may be changed at
     * any time.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionPhaseLaminar - Adjust phases when stretching in
     *   such a way as to try to retain the continuity of phase
     *   relationships between adjacent frequency bins whose phases
     *   are behaving in similar ways.  This, the default setting,
     *   should give good results in most situations.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionPhaseIndependent - Adjust the phase in each
     *   frequency bin independently from its neighbours.  This
     *   usually results in a slightly softer, phasier sound.
     *
     * 6. Flags prefixed \c OptionThreading control the threading
     * model of the stretcher.  These options may not be changed after
     * construction.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionThreadingAuto - Permit the stretcher to
     *   determine its own threading model.  Usually this means using
     *   one processing thread per audio channel in offline mode if
     *   the stretcher is able to determine that more than one CPU is
     *   available, and one thread only in realtime mode.  This is the
     *   default.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionThreadingNever - Never use more than one thread.
     *  
     *   \li \c OptionThreadingAlways - Use multiple threads in any
     *   situation where \c OptionThreadingAuto would do so, except omit
     *   the check for multiple CPUs and instead assume it to be true.
     *
     * 7. Flags prefixed \c OptionWindow control the window size for
     * FFT processing.  The window size actually used will depend on
     * many factors, but it can be influenced.  These options may not
     * be changed after construction.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionWindowStandard - Use the default window size.
     *   The actual size will vary depending on other parameters.
     *   This option is expected to produce better results than the
     *   other window options in most situations.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionWindowShort - Use a shorter window.  This may
     *   result in crisper sound for audio that depends strongly on
     *   its timing qualities.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionWindowLong - Use a longer window.  This is
     *   likely to result in a smoother sound at the expense of
     *   clarity and timing.
     *
     * 8. Flags prefixed \c OptionSmoothing control the use of
     * window-presum FFT and time-domain smoothing.  These options may
     * not be changed after construction.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionSmoothingOff - Do not use time-domain smoothing.
     *   This is the default.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionSmoothingOn - Use time-domain smoothing.  This
     *   will result in a softer sound with some audible artifacts
     *   around sharp transients, but it may be appropriate for longer
     *   stretches of some instruments and can mix well with
     *   OptionWindowShort.
     *
     * 9. Flags prefixed \c OptionFormant control the handling of
     * formant shape (spectral envelope) when pitch-shifting.  These
     * options may be changed at any time.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionFormantShifted - Apply no special formant
     *   processing.  The spectral envelope will be pitch shifted as
     *   normal.  This is the default.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionFormantPreserved - Preserve the spectral
     *   envelope of the unshifted signal.  This permits shifting the
     *   note frequency without so substantially affecting the
     *   perceived pitch profile of the voice or instrument.
     *
     * 10. Flags prefixed \c OptionPitch control the method used for
     * pitch shifting.  These options may be changed at any time.
     * They are only effective in realtime mode; in offline mode, the
     * pitch-shift method is fixed.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionPitchHighSpeed - Use a method with a CPU cost
     *   that is relatively moderate and predictable.  This may
     *   sound less clear than OptionPitchHighQuality, especially
     *   for large pitch shifts.  This is the default.

     *   \li \c OptionPitchHighQuality - Use the highest quality
     *   method for pitch shifting.  This method has a CPU cost
     *   approximately proportional to the required frequency shift.

     *   \li \c OptionPitchHighConsistency - Use the method that gives
     *   greatest consistency when used to create small variations in
     *   pitch around the 1.0-ratio level.  Unlike the previous two
     *   options, this avoids discontinuities when moving across the
     *   1.0 pitch scale in real-time; it also consumes more CPU than
     *   the others in the case where the pitch scale is exactly 1.0.
     *
     * 11. Flags prefixed \c OptionChannels control the method used for
     * processing two-channel audio.  These options may not be changed
     * after construction.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionChannelsApart - Each channel is processed
     *   individually, though timing is synchronised and phases are
     *   synchronised at transients (depending on the OptionTransients
     *   setting).  This gives the highest quality for the individual
     *   channels but a relative lack of stereo focus and unrealistic
     *   increase in "width".  This is the default.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionChannelsTogether - The first two channels (where
     *   two or more are present) are considered to be a stereo pair
     *   and are processed in mid-side format; mid and side are
     *   processed individually, with timing synchronised and phases
     *   synchronised at transients (depending on the OptionTransients
     *   setting).  This usually leads to better focus in the centre
     *   but a loss of stereo space and width.  Any channels beyond
     *   the first two are processed individually.
