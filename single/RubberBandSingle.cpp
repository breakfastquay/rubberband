/*
    RubberBandSingle.cpp
 
    This is a single-file compilation unit for Rubber Band Library.
  
    To use the library in your project without building it separately,
    include in your code either rubberband/RubberBandStretcher.h for
    use in C++ or rubberband/rubberband-c.h if you need the C
    interface, then add this single C++ source file to your build.
 
    Don't move this file into your source tree - keep it in the same
    place relative to the other Rubber Band code, so that the relative
    include paths work, and just add it to your list of build files.
  
    This produces a build using the built-in FFT and resampler
    implementations, except on Apple platforms, where the vDSP FFT is
    used (and where you will need the Accelerate framework when
    linking). It should work correctly on any supported platform, but
    may not be the fastest configuration available. For further
    customisation, consider using the full build system to make a
    standalone library.
