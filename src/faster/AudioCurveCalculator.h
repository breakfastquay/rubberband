 * AudioCurveCalculator turns a sequence of audio "columns" --
 * short-time spectrum magnitude blocks -- into a sequence of numbers
 * representing some quality of the input such as power or likelihood
 * of an onset occurring.
 *
 * These are typically low-level building-blocks: AudioCurveCalculator
 * is a simple causal interface in which each input column corresponds
 * to exactly one output value which is returned immediately.  They
 * have far less power (because of the causal interface and
 * magnitude-only input) and flexibility (because of the limited
 * return types) than for example the Vamp plugin interface.
 *
 * AudioCurveCalculator implementations typically remember the history
 * of their processing data, and the caller must call reset() before
 * resynchronising to an unrelated piece of input audio.
